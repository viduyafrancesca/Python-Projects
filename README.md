# Python-Projects

A list of practical projects that anyone can solve in any programming language (I decided to practice on Python). These projects are divided in multiple categories, and each category has its own folder. Inspired by the list from https://github.com/karan/Projects

# Numbers
1. Find Pi to the Nth place: Find value of Pi up to N decimal places.
2. Find e to the Nth place: Find value of e up to N decimal places.
3. Fibonacci Sequence: Find fibonacci sequence up to Nth number.
4. Prime Factorization: Find all prime factors of N.
5. Next Prime Factor: Find next prime number until user chooses to stop.
6. Total cost of tile: Calculate total cost of tile to cover area given W x H and cost.

# Text
1. FizzBuzz: Print 100 times, "FizzBuzz" for multiples of 3 and 5, "Fizz" for multiple of 3, and "Buzz" for multiple of 5.
2. Reverse given string: Reverse user-provided string.
3. Pig Latin: Implement rules of pig latin in given string.
4. Number of vowels: Print number of vowels in a string.
5. Palindrome checker: Check if user-given string is a palindrome.
6. Count words in string: Count words in user-given text file.
7. Text editor: Notepad that can open, edit, and save text documents.

# Note
This is a work-in-progress, this repository was created to track the progress of my practice in Python. Although inspired by the link above, it can contain other practice topics specific to Python. Thank you!
